## What is this?
Enum "Done Right" is a collection of notes on service enumeration i've put together during my experience.

## How to use
- ```Enumeration.md``` is a file containing a compendium of techniques to enumerate a variety of services
- ```Scanning.md``` is a collection of service scanning functions that you can call on a target like this: ```[function_name] [IP] [service_port]```
