## What is this?
Enum "Done Right" is a collection of notes on service enumeration i've put together during my experience.

## How to use
- ```Enumeration.md``` is a file containing a compendium of techniques to enumerate a variety of services
- ```Scanning.sh``` is a collection of functions that you can call on a target like this: ```[function_name] [IP] [service_port]``` 

To use it effectively, you can copy the functions in your ```~/.bashrc``` or equivalent, so that they become loaded automatically in every terminal session.
